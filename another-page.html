Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm a Computer Science undergrad pursuing from the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun (UPES).

Since I was a kid, I was fascinated by software and computers, in general. I would always tinker around with the most littlest of things in my 2007 Windows XP PC, trying to figure out how it actually works. Overtime, that fascination grew to coding and eventually, cybersecurity, which is what my portfolio is primarily about.
